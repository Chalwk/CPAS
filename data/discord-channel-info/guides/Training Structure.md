**:mortar_board: CPAS Training & Rank Progression**

Our training system is designed around charter operations rather than airline hierarchy.

**Rank Structure (Simplified):**

1. @Pilot Under Training - New pilots, training aircraft only
2. @Charter Pilot - Simple charters, basic fleet access
3. @Senior Charter Pilot - Complex routes, full fleet (except H145)
4. @Lead Pilot - Full fleet access, special operations
5. @Instructor - Training-focused role

**Training Programs:**

- **Fixed-Wing:** Tomahawk → Warrior/Archer → Arrow (complex)
- **Helicopter:** R44 → R66 (turbine) → H125/H145 (mountain/utility)

**Basic Rules:**

- Complete 3 training flights before solo charters
- Progress routes as rank increases
- Always use aircraft checklists
- Ask questions in #training-questions!
