# Coastal Peaks Air Service (CPAS)

This repository contains the static website for **Coastal Peaks Air Service (CPAS)**, a Virtual Charter (VC) and
specialty flight operator for Microsoft Flight Simulator. We operate general aviation aircraft and helicopters for
tours, charters, and HEMS missions, flying realistic routes across New Zealand's South Island. Our
flights cover Canterbury, Christchurch, Banks Peninsula, and the dramatic landscapes of the West Coast and Southern
Alps, offering an experience distinct from traditional virtual airlines.
